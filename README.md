# NeeqSensors
A common repository for the software part of the sensors I build for my Accessible Digital Musical Instruments.
Here you can download the necessary files to reproduce my DIY sensors by your own.

Refer to the page [Sensors](https://neeqstock.github.io/sensors/) in my personal website for instructions on how to build them, both software and hardware part.

Most of them are made using Arduino microcontrollers.
You may need [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) to upload the various code sketches to your Arduino microcontroller.

## Netytar's Breath sensor
1. Clone this repository and open "/Netytar_Breath_Sensor/netytar_breath_sensor.ino";
2. Compile and upload the sketch into your Arduino;
3. Follow the remaining instruction on the [Sensors](https://neeqstock.github.io/sensors/) page in my personal website.

## Netychords' Head sensor
1. Clone this repository and open "/Netychords_Head_Sensor/netychords_head_sensor.ino";
2. Compile and upload the sketch into your Arduino;
3. Follow the remaining instruction on the [Sensors](https://neeqstock.github.io/sensors/) page in my personal website.

## Resin's Head sensor
Resin uses the same head tracking hardware configuration as Netychords. Follow the instructions on Netychords Head sensor above.
